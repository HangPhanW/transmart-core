# transmart-core Github pages

This directory will generate the Github Pages for transmart-core at https://USERNAME.github.io/transmart-core/.
It is recommended to also include the connected https://USERNAME.github.io/transmart/ repository.

## Guidelines

* To prevent the Github pages from becoming cluttered it should only contain the high level essentials to start with the platform. It can refer to other markdown pages in the repository for more details. Examples for specific platforms can be placed on the [tranSMART Foundation wiki](https://wiki.transmartfoundation.org).
* Duplication should be prevented. Instead other pages (like the toplevel [README.md](../README.md)) should refer to the markdown versions of these Github pages where relevant.
* All Github pages should use as little Jekyll magic as possible, making them as readable as possible directly as markdown documents.
