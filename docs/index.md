transmart-core contains the core components of the [tranSMART data warehouse](../transmart/), including:

* Tools to generate the Postgres or Oracle database
* The tranSMART Server, which serves the tranSMART REST API
* The former user interface tranSMART App, which is still used for its administration panel

# Getting started

Start by [installing the latest version of the tranSMART Server](installation.html). Or, if you already have an older version of tranSMART, follow the [upgrade guide](upgrade.html) instead.
